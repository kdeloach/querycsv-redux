<div id="topheader"><div id="subtitle">Execute SQL on CSV files</div></div>
<div id="title">querycsv.py</div>
<div id="content">
<p class="initial"><span class="code">querycsv.py</span> is a Python module and program that allows you to
execute SQL code against data contained in one or more comma-separated-value (CSV) files.
The output of the SQL query will be displayed on the console by default, but may be saved in a new
CSV file.</p>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

<p class="initial">Actions that can be performed with the <span class="code">querycsv</span>
program include:</p>

<ul><li>Execute a single SQL statement, specified on the command line, against the specified data.</li>

<li>Execute multiple SQL statements, read from a script file, against the specified data.</li>

<li>Read data either from one or more CSV files or from a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">Sqlite</a>
data file.</li>

<li>Create a new CSV file containing selected, summarized, data.</li>

<li>Create a Sqlite data file from one or more CSV files.  The Sqlite file can then be used either by
<span class="code">querycsv</span> or by other programs, such as the
<a href="http://www.initd.org/tracker/pysqlite/wiki/SnippetsShell">Python Sqliteplus shell</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Syntax and Options</h2>
<div class="code">    querycsv.py -i &lt;fname&gt; [other options] [SELECT_stmt]

Options:
   -i &lt;fname&gt; Input CSV file name.
              Multiple -i options can be used to specify more than one input file.
   -u &lt;fname&gt; Use the specified sqlite file for input.
              Options -i, -f, and -k are ignored if -u is specified
   -o &lt;fname&gt; Send output to the named CSV file.
   -s         Execute a SQL script from the file given as the argument.
   -f &lt;fname&gt; Use a sqlite file instead of memory for intermediate storage.
   -k         Keep the sqlite file when done (only valid with -f).
   -h         Print this help and exit.
</div>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol><li>The first line of each input (CSV) file must contain column names</li>

<li>Table names used in the SQL should match the input CSV file names, without either the
leading path or the trailing filename extension.</li>

<li>When multiple input files (or a sqlite file with multiple tables) are used, SQL JOIN clauses can be used
to combine the data.</li>

<li>When a SQL script file is used instead of a single SQL commmand on the command line, only
the output of the last SQL command will be displayed.</li>

<li>Output to the console (the default) is formatted for readability.  Output to a disk file
is formatted as CSV, with commas delimiting columns and double quotes around strings.</li>

<li>The primary intended purpose of a command-line SQL statement is to execute
a SELECT or UNION statement against the data, and UPDATE and INSERT statements do not have any
effect on input CSV file(s).  An effect
equivalent to an UPDATE statement can be achieved with SELECT statements, however, with output
directed to a new CSV file.  To perform an INSERT opertation it is necessary to either save the
data in a Sqlite file or to use a script file with separate INSERT and SELECT statements.</li>

<li>The SQL language features that can be used with <span class="code">querycsv</span> are those
supported by <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html">the Sqlite language</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p class="initial">Given an input data file named <span class="code">testdata.csv</span> that
looks like this:</p>

<div class="code">"location_id","sample_date","sample_id","material","analyte","value","units","meas_basis","quals"
"RM708B1","2005-04-07 00:00:00","05144404","Sediment","Aluminum","7310","mg/kg","dry",""
"RM708B1","2005-04-07 00:00:00","05144404","Sediment","Antimony","6.2","mg/kg","dry","UJ"
"RM708B1","2005-04-07 00:00:00","05144404","Sediment","Arsenic","3.9","mg/kg","dry","U"
"RM708B1","2005-04-07 00:00:00","05144404","Sediment","Barium","101","mg/kg","dry",""
"RM708B1","2005-04-07 00:00:00","05144404","Sediment","Beryllium","0.36","mg/kg","dry","J"
"RM708B1","2005-04-07 00:00:00","05144404","Sediment","Cadmium","1.6","mg/kg","dry",""

</div>

<p class="initial">following are several examples of how <span class="code">querycsv</span> could be used.</p>

<h3>Run a simple SELECT statement to extract and display data</h3>

<p class="initial">The code
<div class="code">querycsv.py -i testdata.csv "select distinct analyte from testdata;"
</div>
<p class="initial">will produce output like the following.</p>
<div class="code"> analyte
===========
 Aluminum
 Antimony
 Arsenic
 Barium
 Beryllium
 Cadmium
 . . .
 . .
 .
</div>

<h3>Run a simple SELECT statement to extract data into a new CSV file</h3>

<p class="initial">The code</p>
<div class="code">querycsv.py -i testdata.csv -o maxconc.csv "select analyte, max(value) from testdata group by analyte;"
</div>
<p class="initial">will create a new CSV file named "maxconc.csv" with the following contents.</p>
<div class="code">"analyte","max(value)"
"Aluminum","7310"
"Antimony","7.9"
"Arsenic","6.8"
"Barium","863"
"Beryllium","1.4"
"Cadmium","4.7"
 . . .
 . .
 .
</div>

<h3>Execute multiple SQL statements using a script file</h3>

<p class="initial">To view the number of samples for which each analyte has been measured
in the given data file, the following SQL commands could be used.</p>

<div class="code">create view v_sampanal as
select distinct sample_id, analyte from testdata;

select analyte, count(sample_id) as num_samps
from v_sampanal
group by analyte;
</div>

<p class="initial">If these commands were saved in a text file named "sampcount.sql", the the following code</p>

<div class="code">querycsv.py -i testdata.csv -s sampcount.sql"</div>

<p class="initial">would produce output like the following.</p>

<div class="code"> analyte   | num_samps
=======================
 Aluminum  | 5
 Antimony  | 5
 Arsenic   | 5
 Barium    | 5
 Beryllium | 5
 Cadmium   | 5
 . . .
 . .
 .
</div>

<p class="initial">Note that this is a contrived example, as the same result could be obtained
with a single command as follows.</p>

<div class="code">querycsv.py -i testdata.csv "select analyte, count(sample_id) as num_samps
from (select distinct sample_id, analyte from testdata) group by analyte;"
</div>

<p class="initial">Script files can be useful for solving more complex querying problems, however.
Note that only the output of the last SQL command in a script file is displayed, so that if
input is taken from a Sqlite file, and a view is created (as in the example script above),
then a command to drop the view should not be the last command in the script file.</p>

<p>The end of each SQL command in the script file is identified by a line that ends with a semicolon.
Comment lines are distinguished by two dashes ("--") at the beginning of a line.  No more
sophisticated parsing or interpretation of the SQL commands is done, so comments and SQL
commands should not be placed on the same line, nor should two different SQL commands
be put on the same line.</p>

 <h3>Create and use a Sqlite file</h3>

 <p class="initial">The "-f" and "-k" options can be used to create a Sqlite file, as follows.</p>

 <div class="code">querycsv.py -i testdata.csv -f testdata.sqlite -k "select * from testdata.csv limit 1;"</div>

 <p class="initial">The SQL command used in the previous command line may or may not produce
 useful output, but it must be present.</p>
 <p class="initial">The Sqlite file that was created can then be used as follows.</p>

 <div class="code">querycsv.py -u testdata.sqlite "select distinct location_id from testdata;"</div>

 <p class="initial">Note that the name(s) of the table(s) in the Sqlite file must be known; they will
 not necessarily match the name of the Sqlite file.</p>
